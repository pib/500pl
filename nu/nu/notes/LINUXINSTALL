To install and build Nu on Linux, follow these steps:

1. First make sure you have installed the following packages (these needed
   to be installed after creating a standard Ubuntu 8.04 install):
   git-core
   Rake
   build-essential
   gobjc
   libffi4-dev
   libreadline5-dev

2. Use git to clone Jonathan Yedidia's version of nufound using

% git clone git://github.com/jsyedidia/nufound.git

   You need to use Yedidia's version rather than Tim Burks' because Yedidia includes
   fixes for a couple problems that occur on Ubuntu 8.04.
   Then install the Foundation framework from nufound using the instructions
   in nufound/README.

3. Download pcre-7.7.tar.gz from www.pcre.org.
   Unzip and then build pcre by using (from the pcre-7.7 directory)
  
% ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-utf8
% make
% sudo make install

4. From the main Nu directory:
   
% sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/libNu
% sudo cp -r nu /usr/local/share/libNu

5. From the main Nu directory, use rake to build mininush, a minimal version of the 
   Nu shell:
   
% rake

6. From the main Nu directory, use mininush to run nuke to complete the Nu build
   process:
   
% ./mininush tools/nuke

INSTALL AND TEST NU
-------------------

7. Use mininush again to install Nu, nush, and the Nu tools.

% ./mininush tools/nuke install

Since the copying step uses "sudo", you will be prompted for your password.

6. Test your installation.

% nuke test

(At the moment, the Linux version of Nu fails some tests. This will be fixed.
However, even with the failed tests, Nu appears to be usable on Linux.)

If you modify your version of Nu, either by making your own changes, or by
pulling in a new version of Nu, you should build the new version using the
command:

./mininush tools/nuke install

N.B.: This is different from the procedure on Mac OS X, where you use "nuke install".

ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------
On Darwin, Nu is installed as a framework in /Library/Frameworks. On Linux, it is built
as a dynamic library and installed in /usr/local/lib (or the lib dir of whatever is your 
desired installation prefix). Because nush is linked against libNu.so,
running "nuke install" will crash on Linux when the libNu.so is overwritten. So be sure to 
install with "mininush tools/nuke install".
