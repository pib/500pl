### Installing A+

All it took for me to install A+ was

    apt-get install aplus-fsf

The aplus-fsf package is also available for several other linux distributions, AIX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Tru64 Unix, IRIX, and Max OS X.

They recommend using Emacs for A+ development (for font support if nothing else), but sadly only XEmacs support seems to be provided.  After spending too much time trying to get XEmacs displaying fonts correctly and taking input as I expect it to, I found this article on getting APL working with Unicode http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0225855/unicapl/unicapl.html, which includes code to get regular Emacs working as expected, enabling entering of all the crazy symbols required to program in A+ or APL. It also provides the commands apl-aplus-to-unicode and apl-unicode-to-aplus to convert between the A+ format and unicode.
